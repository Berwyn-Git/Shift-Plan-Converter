# Shift-Plan-Converter
This is a small python project that extracts an Excel file and converts it so that it can be read and updated by the Beisen system.

## Why Do I Need This Project?
To help the PD department avoiding the repeating work of inputting, checking and making tables on the shift-plan table for the HR department.

## What Could This Project Do?
To get the whole shift-plan table of certain time-range, and then convert it into an Excel file that can be accepted by the HR department.
